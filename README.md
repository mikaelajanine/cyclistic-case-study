**Let’s talk bikes**. Specifically, bike-share bikes. If you’ve ever rolled through the city with Cyclistic, your ride might tell a bigger story than you think.

Every trip belongs to either a **casual rider** or a **member** — at least that’s how the system sorts it. But what really separates the two? Are casual riders just in it for the fun? Are members all about the daily grind? Before we assume too much, we need to dig into the data.

This analysis takes a closer look at Cyclistic’s 2019 ride data using R. It’s part of my capstone for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The company might be fictional, but the insights come from real-world public data, which makes it the perfect sandbox to explore what drives rider behavior — and how marketing can turn occasional riders into loyal ones.

Whether you’re into marketing, curious about data, or just wondering why people ride when they do, you’re in the right place.

Let’s dive in.

## Data Analysis

A quick glance at the numbers shows Cyclistic is driven mostly by its loyal members. They account for a huge 89.4% of all rides, while casual riders make up just 10.6%. That gap naturally raises a few questions: What sets these two groups apart? And more importantly, what would it take to turn more casual riders into long-term members?
